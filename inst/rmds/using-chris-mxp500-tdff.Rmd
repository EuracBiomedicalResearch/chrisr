# Introduction

This document describes how the Biocrates MxP500-based targeted metabolomics
data from the CHRIS study [@pattaro_cooperative_2015]
[@verri_hernandes_age_2022] can be loaded and analyzed in R.

The provided *values* for each metabolite are absolute concentrations in
**natural scale**.


# Usage

Data in TDF format is best imported into R using the
[tidyfr](https://github.com/EuracBiomedicalResearch/tidyfr) R package which can
be installed using the code below.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
remotes::install_github("EuracBiomedicalResearch/tidyfr")
```

To load the CHRIS MxP500 metabolomics data, access to the folder with the data
in TDF format is required. The name of the data folder (and hence the name of
the *CHRIS module*) is *metabolomics_MxP500*. Below we list all versions of the
data set available for the this module. In this example we assume the
*metabolomics_MxP500* folder to be present in the current folder in which R is
run. Parameter `path` allows to specify the folder in which CHRIS data modules
are stored (we use `"."` to indicate the current working directory).

```{r}
library(tidyfr)

list_data_modules(path = ".")
```

In this particular case, 2 versions of the module are available. We can next
load the module with the `data_module` function specifying the name of the
module, the version we want to load and also the path where the module can be
found.

```{r}
metabo <- data_module("metabolomics_MxP500", version = "1.0.0.2", path = ".")
```

The `metabo` variable is now a reference to this module which provides some
general information:

```{r}
metabo
```

Note that we could also use the functions `moduleName`, `moduleVersion`,
`moduleDescription` and `moduleDate` to extract these metadata.

The actual data can be loaded with the `data` function. This will read the full
data matrix of analyte (metabolite or lipid) concentrations.

```{r}
metabo_data <- data(metabo)
dim(metabo_data)
```

In this `data.frame`, columns are variables (metabolites/lipids) and rows
samples (i.e. measurements of analytes in CHRIS study samples, or QC
samples). This data set provides the **full** data from the measurements,
i.e. no measurement or value was removed. It is therefore highly advisable to
consider also the coefficient of variation (CV) of each analyte calculated
across the repeatedly measured QC CHRIS POOL sample, as this provides
information on the technical variability of the specific analyte in the present
data set. It is at the researchers discretion to exclude analytes from
downstream analyses based on these QC measurements.

Samples can be identified through the row names of this `data.frame`, which is
either the AID (for CHRIS participants) or an arbitrary name for QC samples
(starting with `"QC"`). Description and information on the individual
**columns** can be loaded with the `labels` function:

```{r}
metabo_ann <- labels(metabo)
```

This `data.frame` contains metadata and additional information on each variable
in `data`:

```{r}
head(metabo_ann)
```

Each row provides annotations for each column in the `metabo_data` `data.frame`
(rows and columns are in the same order). Annotations include the *class* of
metabolite/lipid, its Human Metabolome Database (HMDB) identifier(s) and
identifiers from other databases as well chemical identifiers (inchi, inchikey,
smiles). In cases when metabolites/lipids are annotated to more than one
identifier, these identifiers are concatenated using a `"|"`.

```{r}
stopifnot(all(rownames(metabo_ann) == colnames(metabo_data)))
```

The column *cv_qc_chris* represent the coefficient of variation (CV) calculated
on QC samples, the QC CHRIS Pool samples. As described above, this values thus
represents the technical variability for each metabolite in the present dataset.

While these functions now loaded the data, it is suggested to further process
and reformat the data to simplify its analysis. At first we replace the internal
identifiers for CHRIS labels (i.e. starting with `x0ptx*`) with more meaningful
column names.

```{r}
colnames(metabo_data) <- metabo_ann$description
rownames(metabo_ann) <- metabo_ann$description
```

With that it is much easier to access individual values, e.g. for the analyte
with the id *Gly* (which is the metabolite glycine).

```{r}
quantile(metabo_data$Gly, na.rm = TRUE)
```

As we can see from the values above they are in **natural scale** - so, for data
analysis it might be better to transform them using `log2` or `log10` (which
will also ensure the data to be more Gaussian distributed). See also
[@verri_hernandes_age_2022] for more information on data distribution and
quality.

At last we also evaluate the distribution of the coefficients of variation for
all analytes in the data set.

```{r, fig.cap = "Distribution of the CV per analyte."}
plot(density(metabo_ann$cv_qc_chris, na.rm = TRUE))
```

Most of the analytes have thus a CV < 0.3, which in analytical chemistry is
considered *acceptable*.
