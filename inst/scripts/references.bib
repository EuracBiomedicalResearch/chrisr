	abstract = {SOMAscan is an aptamer-based proteomics assay capable of measuring 1,305 human protein analytes in serum, plasma, and other biological matrices with high sensitivity and specificity. In this work, we present a comprehensive meta-analysis of performance based on multiple serum and plasma runs using the current 1.3 k assay, as well as the previous 1.1 k version. We discuss normalization procedures and examine different strategies to minimize intra- and interplate nuisance effects. We implement a meta-analysis based on calibrator samples to characterize the coefficient of variation and signal-over-background intensity of each protein analyte. By incorporating coefficient of variation estimates into a theoretical model of statistical variability, we also provide a framework to enable rigorous statistical tests of significance in intervention studies and clinical trials, as well as quality control within and across laboratories. Furthermore, we investigate the stability of healthy subject baselines and determine the set of analytes that exhibit biologically stable baselines after technical variability is factored in. This work is accompanied by an interactive web-based tool, an initiative with the potential to become the cornerstone of a regularly updated, high quality repository with data sharing, reproducibility, and reusability as ultimate goals.},

	abstract = {Background:Quality assurance (QA) and quality control (QC) are two quality management processes that are integral to the success of metabolomics including their application for the acquisition of high quality data in any high-throughput analytical chemistry laboratory. QA defines all the planned and systematic activities implemented before samples are collected, to provide confidence that a subsequent analytical process will fulfil predetermined requirements for quality. QC can be defined as the operational techniques and activities used to measure and report these quality requirements after data acquisition.Aim of review:This tutorial review will guide the reader through the use of system suitability and QC samples, why these samples should be applied and how the quality of data can be reported.Key scientific concepts of review:System suitability samples are applied to assess the operation and lack of contamination of the analytical platform prior to sample analysis. Isotopically-labelled internal standards are applied to assess system stability for each sample analysed. Pooled QC samples are applied to condition the analytical platform, perform intra-study reproducibility measurements (QC) and to correct~mathematically for systematic errors. Standard reference materials and long-term reference QC samples are applied for inter-study and inter-laboratory assessment of data.},

	abstract = {SomaScan is a high-throughput, aptamer-based proteomics assay designed for the simultaneous measurement of thousands of proteins with a broad range of endogenous concentrations. In its most current version, the 7k SomaScan assay v4.1 is capable of measuring 7288 human proteins. In this work, we present an extensive technical assessment of this platform based on a study of 2050 samples across 22 plates. Included in the study design were inter-plate technical duplicates from 102 human subjects, which allowed us to characterize different normalization procedures, evaluate assay variability by multiple analytical approaches, present signal-over-background metrics, and discuss potential specificity issues. By providing detailed performance assessments on this wide range of technical aspects, we aim for this work to serve as a valuable resource for the growing community of SomaScan users.},
